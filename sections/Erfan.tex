\textbf{High-accuracy 3d sensing for mobile manipulation: Improving object detection and door opening}
\begin{itemize}
\item Object detection and door opening. Using high resolution depth information 
\item Low-resolution depth information can improve object detection by removing object classifications which are inconsistent with training data
(Direct cite: \textit{http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sgould/papers/eccv08-vision3d.pdf})
\item If a depth sensor's noise is comparable to the size of the target object classes, it will be hard-pressed to provide more than contextual cues. 
\item Active vision techniques: Projecting large patterns onto the scene using a video projector, and observe deformations of the patterns in a camera to infer depth. \\
